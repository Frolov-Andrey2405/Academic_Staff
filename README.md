# Academic_Staff🎓

The project is a 🌐 web-based application called Academic Staff 👨‍🏫 designed to manage faculty data at a university or institution.

## Detailed description📋

🚀 The project is implemented using `Django` web framework and consists of several components, including a database model to store information about academic staff, a set of web templates to visualize the user interface, and a set of `Python` scripts to handle user requests and database operations.

🔎 The basic functionality of the application allows users to browse and search for academic staff by name, department, position, and other attributes. The application also provides an interface for adding, editing, and deleting academic staff data, as well as for managing user accounts and rights.

💾 The `SQLite` database is used to store academic staff data, which is a lightweight and easy-to-use relational database management system. The application uses `Django`'s built-in support for database integration and provides a set of features for performing database operations such as querying, inserting, and updating data.

🛠️ In addition to `Django` and `SQLite`, the project uses a number of other libraries and technologies, including `asgiref` for asynchronous processing of `HTTP` requests and responses, `autopep8` + `Flask8` for code formatting and style compliance, `django-cors-headers` provides middleware that allows `Django` applications to handle cross-original resource sharing requests (CORS), which are HTTP requests made from a domain other than the domain serving the application, `djangorestframework` provides a set of out-of-the-box views and serializers to handle `HTTP` requests and responses in a `RESTful` manner, `Pillow` used in the project to manipulate and process images, and `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS` standard web development technologies used to create the user interface of a web application. `HTML` is used to create the structure and content of web pages, `CSS` is used for styling and layout, and `JS` is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

### Project Idea💡
